# Gesture Control Presenter 🎮🖐️

Control your Google Slides presentations using hand gestures through your laptop camera using Computer Vision and AI.

This project uses:

* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* PyAutoGUI

to detect hand gestures and convert them into presentation controls like:

* Next Slide
* Previous Slide
* Start Presentation
* Exit Presentation

# 📦 Installation

## Step 1 — Clone Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaishnavipadmanabhan2006/Gesture_Control
cd gesture-control
```

---

## Step 2 — Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3 — Download Hand Landmarker Model

```bash
python3 setup_models.py
```

---

# ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python3 main.py
```

# 💻 macOS Permission Setup

For keyboard control to work on macOS:

Go to:

System Settings → Privacy & Security

Enable permissions for:

* Accessibility
* Input Monitoring

Allow access for:

* Terminal
  OR
* VS Code
  OR
* PyCharm

Without these permissions, the app cannot control Google Slides.

For Windows users:

* Open Google Slides and start slideshow mode manually first
* Make sure the slideshow window is active and focused
* The app will send the right-arrow key to advance slides
* If the slideshow goes fullscreen, the camera preview may be hidden behind it — keep the preview window on top or use a second display if possible
